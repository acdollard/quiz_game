# Quiz Game!


## About
This is a simple game that asks the user a series of multiple choice questions on the subject of literature. When clicks the start button, a timer is initiated that counts down to zero, and will end the game if the user is not finished before time is up. The user is then able to enter their name in an input box, and the name and score are saved in local storage. Enjoy!
